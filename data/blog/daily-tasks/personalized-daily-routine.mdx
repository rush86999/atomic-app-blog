## Using a Personal Daily Routine

“The most important factor in life is not who we are or what we are doing, but what we have become by what we have done. You become what you do.” — John Wooden

Do you have a daily routine? Do you plan out your day in advance? Do you have the ability to stick to your routine every day and throughout the week?

If you are not organized enough to create an effective daily routine, then you are probably making decisions on a daily basis that are not in accordance with your goals and beliefs.

In order to help you create your ideal daily routine, you need to know what routines work for you and the things that you need to avoid.

I am going to share with you a framework that will help you create a personal daily routine.

## Daily Routine Matrix

Before we get started, I want to share with you a concept that I learned from an online course called “The 4 Hour Workweek” by Tim Ferris.

The concept is a daily routine matrix that will help you make better decisions throughout the day.

The Daily Routine Matrix is made up of two columns. The left column contains activities that you do every day and the right column contains actions that you need to avoid.

The goal of the Daily Routine Matrix is to help you get rid of unnecessary activities in favor of ones that will help you achieve your goals and develop your life.

Here are some examples of the daily routine matrix:

### Every day, make sure to do these 11 things.

1. Get up at X AM

There’s no reason to get out of bed if you want to stay in bed. And there’s never a good reason to stay in bed.

2. Eat breakfast

This is an important activity to do every single day. Do it every day, no matter what.

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You need to eat enough to make up for all the nutrients you’ve lost while you were sleeping.

3. Drink water

It’s important to have pure, clean water to drink every single day. It’s essential for your body to function.

4. Exercise

Do some form of exercise every day.

5. Get at least 30 minutes of sunlight or sunlight exposure

6. Read

Reading is a great way to spend your free time. Even if you only read for 15 minutes every day, that’s still enough to help you grow as a person.

7. Meditate for 15 minutes

Meditation is another great way to use your free time.

8. Walk

Walking is a great way to get exercise and spend some quality time with yourself every day.

9. Get enough sleep

It’s important to get enough sleep every night. The less you get, the lower your ability to focus is in the morning.

10. Eat healthy meals

Eating a healthy breakfast and lunch is a great way to start the day.

11. Walk every day

Get in the habit of walking around every day. It’s an easy way to get exercise.
