The Pomodoro Technique is a method used to improve productivity. It takes 30 minutes of concentrated work followed by a 5-minute break. After four Pomodoro sessions, a 20-minute break is taken.

In his book, The Pomodoro Technique, author and entrepreneur Francesco Cirillo says the technique helps him focus better, and makes him feel more accomplished.

“In fact, I’ve used this method for many years and I’ve found it to be quite effective in terms of productivity,” Cirillo says. “I’m able to get more done in a shorter time frame.”

The Pomodoro Technique is based on the principle that there is a correlation between the number of distractions you get while working and the amount of time it takes to complete a task.

For example, Cirillo says that if you have more than three interruptions, it could take you an extra 30 minutes to complete a task.

“That’s one of the reasons why it’s so effective,” he says. “It forces you to focus on the task at hand. If you have just a few distractions, then you would be able to sustain your focus for a very long time.”

There are four steps to using the Pomodoro Technique:

Set a timer for 25 minutes. Work on one task for that 25 minutes. When the timer rings, take a five-minute break. Repeat this cycle until you have worked for a total of four sessions. Take a 20-minute break.

Cirillo says the most important aspect of this technique is to set aside time to focus on one task.

“If you allow yourself to get distracted and go on Facebook or Twitter, then you’re not going to be able to complete a task in the same period of time as someone who is not distracted,” he says.

The other crucial element of the Pomodoro Technique is to take a break.

“I see the Pomodoro Technique as a way to get more work done in less time. That is the reason why I like it,” Cirillo says.

What is a pomodoro?

A pomodoro is a small, kitchen timer made by the Italian company, TomTom. Cirillo says he likes to use a digital version of the timer because it’s easier to track his productivity.

“I can set the timer on my phone and I’ll know once it’s done when the phone dings,” he says.

Cirillo says he’s used the Pomodoro Technique to complete several projects, including his book, The Business of Being a Professional Writer. It took him 10 months to research and write the book.

“I would have a Pomodoro going while I was working on it,” he says. “It’s very easy to see your progress when you break your day down into 25-minute chunks.”

Another example of Cirillo using the Pomodoro Technique was when he completed the book, Write to Done: 30 Simple Techniques for a Productive Writing Life.

“I was able to write 1,000 words per day. That’s more than one chapter per week. That shows what you can do with the Pomodoro Technique,” he says.

Cirillo says he uses the timer when he works with his clients as well.

“If I’m coaching a client, I’ll set a timer for 25 minutes and work on their site or with their business,” he says.

Once work is done, Cirillo sets another timer for 25 minutes and then takes his break.

“I’d say I take a 10-minute break for every hour that I’m working,” he says. “I’m able to get more done in a shorter period of time than I would otherwise.”

The Pomodoro Technique is not meant to be used for all types of work. It’s meant to be used for tasks that are not creative, or tasks that require very deep concentration, Cirillo says.

“If you are working on a project that requires you to be creative, then you should use the Pomodoro Technique for one-hour blocks,” he says. “However, if you are working on a task like writing articles, emails or reports, then you would be better off breaking it up into 25-minute sessions.”

Cirillo says the Pomodoro Technique is most effective when the timer goes off every 25 minutes.

“If you work for a longer period of time, then you tend to get distracted and lose your focus,” he says. “This technique forces you to focus on the task at hand because you know that you are going to take a break after every 25 minutes.”

How to use the pomodoro technique

Here’s how you can use the Pomodoro Technique to improve your productivity.

You need a timer. Cirillo recommends a kitchen timer or a digital timer.

Set your timer for 25 minutes. Use the Pomodoro Technique for 25 minute blocks of work, followed by a five-minute break.

If you work for more than 25 minutes, take a 10-minute break. Repeat this cycle until the timer rings.
